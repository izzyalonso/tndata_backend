goals app
=========

This app stores information related to personal Goals.

Goals are essentially categories for content, and are tagged/organized by
[Self Determination Theory](http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=68)
and [Max Neef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_Max_Neef)'s
[Fundamental Human Needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_human_needs)
criterial.

This app gives us a way to store and organize Goals, as well as a way to record
which goals a user selects, which Behaviors they choose to aspire to, which of
those behavior steps they complete, as well as any custom reminders for those
behavior steps.
