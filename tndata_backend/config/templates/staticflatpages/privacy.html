Data Commons provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Data Commons Websites, Compass software and/or the Compass Service. If you do not agree to our practices, please do not use the Data Commons Websites, Compass software, or the Compass Service.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Data Commons Terms of Service. Your use of the Data Commons Websites, Compass software and the Compass Service and any personal information you provide on the Data Commons Websites or Compass Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy is part of The Data Commons Terms of Service and covers the treatment of user information, including personally identifying information, obtained by Data Commons, including information obtained when you access the the Data Commons Site, use the Compass Service, or any other software provided by Data Commons.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Data Commons does not own or control, or to individuals whom Data Commons does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which Data Commons may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>The Information Data Commons Collects</h2>
<p>Data Commons may obtain the following types of information from or concerning you or your mobile phone device, which may include information that can be used to identify you as specified below (“Personally Identifying Information”):</p>
<p><strong>User Provided Information</strong>: You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, demographics, mobile phone number, and mobile device information to Data Commons when choosing to participate in various uses of the Compass Service, such as registering as a user, setting goals, choosing activities, and receiving notifications.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies Information</strong>: When you visit the Data Commons Websites, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Data Commons uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, the Data Commons Websites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Log File Information</strong>: When you use the Data Commons Websites, the Compass Software, or the Compass Service, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser and/or your Compass app sends whenever you visit any website or browse Compass Content. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, your phone number, phone number you are requesting the status of and various status information. When you use the Compass Service, our servers log certain information about your goal and activity choices and the way you interact with the Compass Software or with your phone’s notification service through which Compass sends you notifications.</p>
<h2>The Way Data Commons Uses Information</h2>
<p>If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the Data Commons Websites, or Compass Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Data Commons Websites and Compass Service. Any Personally Identifiable Information or User Information that you voluntarily disclose on the Compass Service is collected and used by Data Commons until you request that Data Commons delete your User Information. We do not use your User Information or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your User Information without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Data Commons Websites or Compass Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality, functionality, and design of the Data Commons Websites and Compass Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Compass Service or Data Commons Websites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.</p>
<h2>When Data Commons Discloses Information</h2>
<p>We do not sell or share your User Information or Personally Identifiable Information with other third-party companies for their own use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the Compass Service. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, and/or functionality on the Data Commons Websites or the Compass Service. We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual’s physical safety may be at risk or threatened. Data Commons also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Data Commons believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Data Commons Websites or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Data Commons, our users or others.</p>
<h2>Your Choices</h2>
<p>You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Data Commons Websites or the Compass Service, in which case Data Commons may not be able to provide certain services to you. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, please delete your account, uninstall the Data Commons mobile application and discontinue use of the Compass Service; your continued usage of the Compass Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before registering you and granting you access to the Compass Service. Please contact Data Commons via email to support at tndata.org or available web forms with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices.</p>
<h2>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>We are not fans of advertising. Data Commons is currently ad-free and we hope to keep it that way forever. We have no intention to introduce advertisement into the product. If we ever do, we will update this section.</p>
<h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
<p>Data Commons uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Data Commons and you do so at your own risk. Using unsecured wifi or other unprotected networks to submit messages through the Compass Service is never recommended. Once we receive your transmission of information, Data Commons makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. If Data Commons learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Data Commons may post a notice on the Data Commons Websites or through the Compass Service if a security breach occurs.</p>
<h2>Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</h2>
<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Data Commons does not knowingly collect or maintain Personally Identifiable Information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Data Commons Websites or Compass Service from persons under 14 years of age, and no part of the Compass Service is directed to or intended to be used by persons under 14. If you are under 14 years of age, then please do not use the Compass Service or access the Data Commons Websites at any time or in any manner. If Data Commons learns that Personally Identifiable Information of persons under 14 years of age has been collected on the Data Commons Websites or Compass Service, then Data Commons may deactivate the account and/or make the User Information inaccessible.</p>
<h2>Special Note to International Users</h2>
<p>The Data Commons Websites and Service are hosted in the United States and are intended for and directed to users in the United States. If you are a user accessing the Data Commons Websites and Service from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Data Commons Websites and Service, which are governed by Tennessee law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you expressly consent to that transfer and consent to be governed by Tennessee law for these purposes.</p>
<h2>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>In the event that Data Commons is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the (hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
<h2>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Data Commons Websites and Compass Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any amendments.</p>
